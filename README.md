# Frontend Mentor - Launch countdown timer

![Design preview for the Launch countdown timer coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg) 

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this countdown timer and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 8 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## Create with
  
  HTML5 markup
  CSS custom properties
  Saas
  Flexbox
  Javascript

## What I learned
I learnt how to use saas effectively that helps to organize the styling in a readable format and also, I learnt the @mixing and @include which allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They make it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes like .float-left, and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.

I also learnt an effective way of using javascript function and the conditional statement. Here is the code that makes the counter work:

``` if (newNumber === startNumber) return // The golden code ```

## What I can do differently

If I should go back to do this project again, I will learn and implement the use of @mixing and @include for reusable styling and animation. 

**Happy Coding!** ðŸš€
